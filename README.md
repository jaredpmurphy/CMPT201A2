Game: Escape from the Haunted Manor
Collect enough coins, and the door in the bottom right will open for you to escape.
If you get caught by a ghost, you will respawn, lose a life, and lose a single coin.
If you run out of lives, game over!
Use arrow keys to move, SPACE to collect a coin when next/on it, and avoid ghosts at all costs!
Press 'q' to quit, or 'p' to pause/unpause.
